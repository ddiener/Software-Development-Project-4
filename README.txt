Hello! 

My name is Dylan Diener and this is my Project 4 submission for
CSCI 1302 at UGA. Compiling this program is very similar to 
compiling the other programs that I have submitted for this course.

In the classes directory, there are three jar files to compile the
MP3Player file, one jar file for jUnit testing, and the rest 
of the .class files of the compiled source code located in the 
edu/uga/cs1302/mp3files/ directory.

There is also a directory titled html that contains all javadoc
notation of the source code as well. 

There is also this read me document.

Please contact me with any questions!
